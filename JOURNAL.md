## 11/5/2025 - Prepare the set-top box code  

I found that the software I need only has an amd64 version, not an arm64, so I have to decompile it and recompile it into arm64, so I first completed the decompilation of the source code

Fortunately, it is written in election, which is very easy to decompile

## 11/10/2025 - Designing client circuits and PCB  

I plan to separate the client and use ESP32 as the client
I designed a small circuit that can be conveniently carried on the go, and drew a double-sided PCB to further reduce the size. According to my calculations, it should be able to be worn on the wrist as a watch
